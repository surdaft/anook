# What is this repo?
I am developing a wordpress plugin for general anook integrations; widgets, shortcodes, general things that aid your blog connecting with anook. The plugin was initially made a long time ago but this is a complete rewrite to follow correct PSR-4 standard, OOPHP and other fancy things that make the code a lot cleaner and easier to integrate on top of.

# What is Anook?
(Anook)[https://www.anook.com] is a website that I like to use, it is built for gamers and by gamers. The whole website is designed around the idea that you are friends with people but you only see their posts if you enjoy the game.

## Future plans
* The key change I would like to implement in the future that I cannot right now is utilising OAuth to get your anook username, at the moment it is required that you just type it in and hope that you are an honourable Sur.
